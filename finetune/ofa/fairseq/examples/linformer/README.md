# Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity (Wang et al., 2020)

This example contains code to train Linformer models as described in our paper
[Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04768).

## Training a new Linformer RoBERTa model

You can mostly follow the [RoBERTa pretraining README](/examples/roberta/README.pretraining.md),
updating your training command with `--user-dir examples/linformer/linformer_src --arch linformer_roberta_base`.
